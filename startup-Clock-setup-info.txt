SYSCLK source: PLL 
PLL configuration:
* driven by HSE which has 8 MHz quartz (i.e. PLLSRC = 1,  <encoded val> = 1)
* PLL prescaler = 1/2, (i.e. PLLXTPRE = 1 <encoded val> = 1)
* PLL frequency multipler (i.e. PLLMUL) = 2 <encoded val> = 0

* resulting in: 
    f_SYSCLK = 8 MHz / 2 * 2 = 8 MHz    
    (not to exceed 72 MHz)
    (not exceeding 24 MHz so no need for flash wait state(s) )
    (also no need to prescale other APB1,2 clocks)

* from f_SYSCLK to f_SysTick_Input 
    * assume 
        - HPRE = 1/2 <encoded val = 8> and 
        - SysTick ClockSource as HCLK prescaled by 1 (as set in the SysTick_Config subroutine)
    * resulting in:
        f_SysTick_Input = f_SYSCLK / 2/ 1  = 4 MHz
